# CalculatorFinalCS155
## Project Description: 
This program is a simple calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide up to two-digit integers. I attempted to implement floating-point division, but I was unable to finish, so the division feature performs simple integer division. To perform an arithmetic operation, enter 2 two-digit values separated by an operator ('+', '-', '*', or '/'). The program reads the two values and calls the appropriate subroutine based on the operator. Since the result can be up to 4 digits long, it also calls a subroutine to convert the result to a string for display.
